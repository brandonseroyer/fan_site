Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?


Is there good spec coverage?
*There is testing for validation, but not relationships between models. Also no integration specs.

Do all specs pass?
*Yes

Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
* Genres: Tabbing on genres/show... and genres/index unclear, but logic is nice and clean. Genres controller is nice and easy to understand.

*Artists: Tabbing on artists/show... is unclear, but logic is very nice and clean. Artists controller is nice and neat and easy to follow.

*Reviews:

Is the site user-friendly?
When you edit a band in a genre, it would be cool to be redirected to that genre's page instead of the list of all the genres. And when you delete a review to be redirected back to the band's page. Less clicking is friendly to us lazy people.

Are there opportunities for refactoring?
Everything was really simple and neat, so nothing jumped out at me.

What features stand out?
Really like that you added a third model!


What features could be improved?
The critique text_area could be labeled. I knew to put text in there, but it could be unclear for people who don't spend a lot of time online or doing these exercises over and over again.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
Changing the root route to genres#index or noting to start at localhost:3000/genres would be
helpful for users.
Everything seemed to stick to the conventions which made it easy to follow and the name is cool.
